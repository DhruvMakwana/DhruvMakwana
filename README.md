### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a AI Engineer at Ignitarium Technology Solutions and Independent Researcher working on research papers.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
1. Implementing Solution for Low Light Image ehancement using Generative Adversarial Network and Normalization flow.
2. Implementing Ultra light-weight model for Parkinson's disease detection using multi-modelalities.
3. All-In-One Image Restoration for any image property Corruption
4. Implementing 3D Object Detection models in PyTorch

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
1. Optimization methods
2. Stable Diffusion
3. Neural Radiance Fields
4. Large Language Models

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
1. Implementing research papers in computer vision.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
1. Generative Adversarial Networks
2. 3D Point Cloud Generation and Reconstuction
3. Contrastive Learning and Its uses
